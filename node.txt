Single thread works in node.

It is developed in C++, as it can directly access kernel which makes it faster.

The single tread mechanism work by making an event queue of all requests. Then the request is divided into 2 queues: Blocking(Promises, async await etc which takes time) and non-blocking event.
A loop is generated between them and when the blocking event is done it goes into processing.

When a request is made it is sent to route, which finds the correct route and sends the request there. From there the controller connects with database and
performs the task needed to be done and sends appropriate response.
